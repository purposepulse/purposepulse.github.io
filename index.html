            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Mafalda. A dreamer and a humanitarian who believes in strong healthy life foundations like empowered connections, work-life balance and personal growth.</p>

            <h2>My journey</h2>
            <p>My dream career was always people centric, but it all started with a Masters’ degree in Science of Education from the Psychology Faculty in Porto University, Portugal. I studied the basics of psychology and then moved to people in their social contexts and how they behaved in their social circles and within their social connections. Years later I ended up working in HR and did a one year Post-graduation in Human Resources Management while working full-time.</p>
            <p>In 2020, as the pandemic hit, I got scared with life and how it seems to be so fragile and short. I always loved people, but that doesn’t mean to only work with them in corporate contexts. I started working from home but as we were in a middle of an unknown phenomenon and pandemic no one could leave their houses safely. I felt like I was seeing the world through a tiny window that kept becoming smaller as the weeks and months passed by. Workload was always increasing as companies were facing new challenges.</p>
            <p>At this point, I was working almost 24/7 without being paid extra hours and no other way out. Felt trapped, small, helpless, frustrated and I began to feel a lot of anxiety related to uncertainty and unfulfilled dreams. Irrational fears about how I would die without knowing nothing but places and people I’ve known my whole life and who were culturally too similar started hitting! So I left my well-paid corporate job as an HR Manager to grab the possibility to expand and grow with the love of my life and with everyone we met along the way, throughout the world.</p>
            <p>Four years of HR work experience later, I am now married and have travelled to more than 20 countries. I’m still so passionate about people and their connections, that I decided to pursue a career as a Life Coach. So here I am, a now Internationally Certified Coach from the Association for Coaching, eager to work with you for the life of your dreams! </p>
            <p>I am committed to help you create more awareness and re-design your life to fit your own patterns of a fulfilled & successful self.</p>
